# Railway's Performance Analytic

## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides insights into railway performance metrics, focusing on various aspects such as revenue generation, station coverage, punctuality, station-wise traffic, customer satisfaction, and revenue distribution over time. The data visualization is powered by Power BI, offering an intuitive interface for exploring and analyzing railway performance data.

Additionally, your Power BI analytics focus on specific stations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. These analytics provide in-depth insights into station-specific performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement targeted improvements to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "Station Lookup", "Ticket Sales Data" , "Train Lookup" & "Train Performance Data" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present
